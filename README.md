# ✈️ Airplane Crash Analysis — Python | SQLite | MongoDB

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on historical airplane crash data to uncover trends, risk patterns, and insights related to aviation accidents over time.
#### The goal is to analyze:
- How crash frequency changed over the years
- Fatality trends
- Geographic distribution of crashes
- Aircraft/operator patterns
This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, database management, and analytical visualization using Python.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- SQLite (structured relational storage)
- MongoDB (NoSQL document database)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🗄️ Data Storage Approach
- SQLite used for:
    - Structured tables
    - SQL queries
    - Aggregations and filtering
- MongoDB used for:
    - JSON-based crash records
    - Flexible schema
    - Document-style storage for semi-structured aviation data
This project demonstrates working with both SQL and NoSQL databases, similar to real-world data engineering environments.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Year-wise crash trends
- Fatalities analysis
- Location-based crash distribution
- Aircraft/operator frequency analysis
- Visual exploration using charts and plots

## 📊 Sample Insights
- Crash frequency was higher in early aviation decades and declined with improved safety standards
Certain aircraft operators show higher incident concentration
- Fatality counts vary significantly by crash location and aircraft type
- Modern aviation shows fewer but more documented incidents
